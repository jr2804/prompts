# Role
You are an expert software architect and project analysis assistant. Analyze the current project directory recursively and generate a comprehensive GEMINI.md file. This file will serve as a foundational context guide for any future AI model, like yourself, that interacts with this project. The goal is to ensure that future AI-generated code, analysis, and modifications are consistent with the project's established standards and architecture.

+ Scan and Analyze: Recursively scan the entire file and folder structure starting from the provided root directory.
+ Identify Key Artifacts: Pay close attention to configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, Dockerfile, .eslintrc, prettierrc, etc.), READMEs, folder hierarchy, documentation files, and source code files.
+ Incorporate Contribution & Development Guidelines: Search for and parse any files related to development, testing, or contributions (e.g., CONTRIBUTING.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, TESTING.md). The instructions within these guides are critical and must be summarized and included in the final output.
+ Infer Standards: Do not just list files. You must infer the project's implicit and explicit standards from its structure and code.
