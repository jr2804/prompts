# AGENTS.md

Agent instruction set. Not human docs — not injected on every LLM call if
DOX-hierarchy child AGENTS.md covers the area being edited.

## DOX — self-documenting AGENTS.md hierarchy

### Core Contract

- AGENTS.md files are binding work contracts for their subtrees.
- Work products, source materials, instructions, records, assets, and durable docs
  must stay understandable from the nearest applicable AGENTS.md plus every parent
  AGENTS.md above it.
- Do not duplicate/repeat rules declared elsewhere in the DOX tree (parent, child,
  sibling, or `.agents/`). See **DOX authoring** in `.agents/POLICIES.md`.

### Read Before Editing

1. Read the root AGENTS.md
2. Identify every file or folder you expect to touch
3. Walk from the repository root to each target path
4. Read every AGENTS.md found along each route
5. If a parent AGENTS.md lists a child AGENTS.md whose scope contains the path, read that child and continue from there
6. Use the nearest AGENTS.md as the local contract and parent docs for repo-wide rules
7. If docs conflict, the closer doc controls local work details, but no child doc may weaken DOX

Do not rely on memory. Re-read the applicable DOX chain in the current session before editing.

### Update After Editing

Every meaningful change requires a DOX pass before the task is done.

Update the closest owning AGENTS.md when a change affects:

- purpose, scope, ownership, or responsibilities
- durable structure, contracts, workflows, or operating rules
- required inputs, outputs, permissions, constraints, side effects, or artifacts
- user preferences about behavior, communication, process, organization, or quality
- AGENTS.md creation, deletion, move, rename, or index contents

Update parent docs when parent-level structure, ownership, workflow, or child index
changes. Update child docs when parent changes alter local rules. Remove stale or
contradictory text immediately. Small edits that do not change behavior or contracts
may leave docs unchanged, but the DOX pass still must happen.

### Hierarchy

- Root AGENTS.md is the DOX rail: project-wide instructions, global preferences, durable workflow rules, and the top-level Child DOX Index
- Child AGENTS.md files own domain-specific instructions and their own Child DOX Index
- Each parent explains what its direct children cover and what stays owned by the parent
- The closer a doc is to the work, the more specific and practical it must be

### Child Doc Shape

- Create a child AGENTS.md when a folder becomes a durable boundary with its own purpose, rules, responsibilities, workflow, materials, or quality standards
- Work Guidance must reflect the current standards of the project or user instructions; if there are no specific standards or instructions yet, leave it empty
- Verification must reflect an existing check; if no verification framework exists yet, leave it empty and update it when one exists

Default section order:

- Purpose
- Ownership
- Local Contracts
- Work Guidance
- Verification
- Child DOX Index

### Style

Authoring rules live in **DOX authoring** (`.agents/POLICIES.md`) — tier
assignment, reference-don't-restate, rule-first rationale, size budget.
Apply them on every DOX change. Summary:

- A rule lives in the **highest tier that fully applies**; when unsure, `.agents/POLICIES.md`.
- Reference, don't restate — one canonical home, pointer lines everywhere else.
- Keep docs concise, current, and operational. Document stable contracts, not diary entries.

### Closeout

1. Re-check changed paths against the DOX chain
2. Update nearest owning docs and any affected parents or children
3. Refresh every affected Child DOX Index
4. Remove stale or contradictory text
5. Run existing verification when relevant
6. Report any docs intentionally left unchanged and why

### User Preferences

When the user requests a durable behavior change, record it here or in the relevant child AGENTS.md

### Child DOX Index

| Path | Covers |
|------|--------|
| `skills/AGENTS.md` | Skill authoring contract — spec compliance, script metadata, agent-neutrality, skill creation via `skill-creator` |
| `skills/standards/AGENTS.md` | Standards-document skills — `.docx` generation for SDOs (ETSI, 3GPP, ITU-T) |

## .agents/ files — demand-loaded, not always injected

| File             | Load when                   | Purpose                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `ONBOARDING.md`  | New session (first time)    | Project orientation, entry points               |
| `POLICIES.md`    | Always                      | Boundaries, priorities, verification, checklist |
| `FILES.md`       | Touching files or config    | Path constants, source-of-truth locations       |
| `HISTORY.md`     | Background (past decisions) | Recorded decisions with git refs                |
| `MAINTENANCE.md` | Changing `.agents/`         | How to keep DOX files current                   |

## Project rules

_Always-injected_ — keep minimal. Everything else → `.agents/` files.

- **`uv run`** for all Python execution. Never `python` / `python3` directly.
- **Agent Skills spec compliance** — every created/updated skill conforms to <https://agentskills.io/specification>; validate with `uvx skills-ref validate`.
- **Agent-neutral skills** — skill text must be agent-agnostic (no "Claude"/"Gemini"/"Qwen"/"Copilot"); use "agents"/"LLMs"/"you". Full rules + audit checklist live in `skills/AGENTS.md`.
- **Pointers over duplication** — prefer referencing canonical files over restating guidance; one home per rule.
- **Minimal, targeted edits** — no unrelated refactoring while fixing a bug; verify an equivalent pattern does not already exist before adding new logic or files.
- **Short, high-signal root docs** — no long prose, no auto-generated file trees (generate on demand via `rg --files | tree-cli --fromfile`).
